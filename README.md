# Pose_detection_project_with_cnn

Step 1:
Image visualization and processing to understand the data. using image_processing file

Step 2:
Generating a CSV file ('data.csv') containing image url, yaw, pitch and roll using the image dataset AFLW2000 provided in dataLink.txt file and using yaw_pitch_roll_detectin_task file
Step 3:
Creating a CNN model and fed the data.csv file to the model to train using CNN_model file

Step4:
Testing an image on the model and draw yaw, pitch and roll
